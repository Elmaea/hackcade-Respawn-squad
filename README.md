## Game Description
Dream Dash is a fun 2D side-scrolling runner where you race through ever-changing dream worlds. It’s not just about dodging obstacles — the game keeps surprising you with twists like flipped gravity, disappearing platforms, and surreal changes that turn the run into an unpredictable adventure.

## The Concept
Theme: Player is stuck in a surreal dreamscape (floating platforms, random portals).

Gameplay: Endless runner/platformer, but environment changes randomly every few seconds (gravity flips, colors invert, controls swap).

Twist: “Dream logic” keeps it unpredictable and fun.

Why cool: Adds humor + surprise with minimal coding (just random state changes)
